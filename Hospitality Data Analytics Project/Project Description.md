# Hospitality Insights Analysis - AtliQ Pvt. Ltd.




## Project Description

This project aims to provide insights to AtliQ Pvt. Ltd., which owns chains of hotels across multiple cities in India. The objective is to identify the factors influencing customer acquisition metrics. The analysis focuses on various metrics such as Average Daily Rating (ADR) and occupancy distribution, categorized by different levels of daily and weekly metrics.
## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Project Workflow

- **Understanding Stakeholder Suggestions**: We carefully reviewed and documented the stakeholder suggestions regarding the potential dashboard requirements, drawing insights from the provided mockup dashboard.

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: We collected data from relevant sources and meticulously cleaned any irregularities using the PowerBI Query editor.

- **Data Integration and Optimization**: We established relationships between multiple data sources, organizing them into a structure of facts and dimension tables. This ensures efficient data retrieval and optimizes dashboard updates.

- **Metric Creation**: Utilizing DAX, we crafted over 20 key metrics such as DSRN, ADR, and RevPAR. These metrics provide crucial insights into the business performance and facilitate decision-making.

- **Dashboard Design**: We designed a visually captivating dashboard, showcasing the key metrics of the business. This includes presenting weekly revenue trends and analyzing weekday/weekend occupancy distributions, among other insights.

- **Recommendation Given**: Provided recommendations to the stakeholders after thoroughly reviewing the final dashboard, which highlighted key performance drawbacks observed in select hotels in Delhi and Hyderabad. These drawbacks were primarily attributed to low booking rates, potentially influenced by low ratings received by those hotels.
